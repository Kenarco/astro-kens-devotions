## Romans 1:8-17 ##

(Rom 1:8)  First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.
<br>
(Rom 1:9)  For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you
<br>
(Rom 1:10)  always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
<br>
(Rom 1:11)  For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you—
<br>
(Rom 1:12)  that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
<br>
(Rom 1:13)  I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.
<br>
(Rom 1:14)  I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
<br>
(Rom 1:15)  So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
<br>
(Rom 1:16)  For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
<br>
(Rom 1:17)  For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”


## He expressed his concern ##

We can well understand Paul’s concern for the churches that he founded, but why would he be concerned about the believers at Rome? He was unknown to many of them, yet he wanted to assure them that he was deeply concerned about their welfare. Note the evidences of Paul’s concern.

## He Was Thankful for them ##

“The whole world”—meaning the whole Roman Empire—knew of the faith of the Christians at Rome. Travel was relatively common in that day and “all roads led to Rome.” It is no wonder that the testimony of the church spread abroad, and this growing witness made Paul’s ministry easier as he went from place to place, and was able to point to this testimony going out from the heart of the Roman Empire.

## He Prayed for them ##

They did not know of Paul’s prayer support, but the Lord knew about it and honored it. (I wonder how many of us know the people who are praying for us?) One of the burdens of Paul’s prayer was that God would permit him to visit Rome and minister to the churches there. He would have visited them sooner, but his missionary work had kept him busy (Rom. 15:15–33). He was about to leave Corinth for Jerusalem to deliver the special offering received from the Gentile churches for the poor Jewish saints. He hoped he would be able to travel from Jerusalem to Rome, and then on to Spain; and he was hoping for a prosperous journey.

Actually, Paul had a very perilous journey; and he arrived in Rome a prisoner as well as a preacher. In Jerusalem he was arrested in the temple, falsely accused by the Jewish authorities and eventually sent to Rome as the Emperor’s prisoner to be tried before Caesar. When Paul wrote this letter, he had no idea that he would go through imprisonment and even shipwreck before arriving in Rome! At the close of the letter (Rom. 15:30–33), he asked the believers in Rome to pray for him as he contemplated this trip; and it is a good thing that they did pray

## He Loved them ##

 “I long to see you!” This is the pastor’s heart in Paul the great missionary. Some of the saints in Rome were very dear to Paul, such as Priscilla and Aquila (Rom. 16:3–4), who risked their lives for him; “the beloved Persis” (Rom. 16:12); and others who had labored and suffered with Paul. But he also loved the believers that he did not know, and he longed to be able to share some spiritual gift with them. He was looking forward to a time of mutual blessing in the love of Christ.

## He was in debt to them ##

As the apostle to the Gentiles, Paul had an obligation to minister in Rome. He would have fulfilled that obligation sooner, but his other labors had hindered him. Sometimes Paul was hindered because of the work of Satan (1 Thes. 2:17–20); but in this case he was hindered because of the work of the Lord. There was so much to do in Asia Minor and Greece that he could not immediately spare time for Rome. But Paul had to pay his debt; he was under orders from the Lord.

The Greeks considered every non-Greek a barbarian. Steeped in centuries of philosophy, the Greeks saw themselves as wise and everyone else as foolish. But Paul felt an obligation to all men, just as we need to feel a burden for the whole world. Paul could not be free from his debt until he had told as many people as possible the Good News of salvation in Christ.

## He was eager to visit them ##

Two different Greek words are translated “ready” in the King James Version. One means “prepared,” as in Acts 21:13. “I am ready … to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” The other one, used in Romans 1:15, means “eager, with a ready mind.” Paul was not eager to die, though he was prepared to die. But he was eager to visit Rome that he might minister to the believers there. It was not the eagerness of a sightseer, but the eagerness of a soul-winner.

After reading these five evidences of Paul’s concern for the Christians at Rome, these saints could not but give thanks to God for the Apostle Paul and his burden to come and minister to them. Actually, the Epistle to the Romans in which Paul explained the Gospel he preached, was his letter of introduction that prepared the believers for his visit. No doubt the false teachers had already gotten to Rome and were seeking to poison the Christians against Paul (see Rom. 3:8). Some would accuse him of being anti-Law; others would say he was a traitor to the Jewish nation. Still others would twist his teaching about grace and try to prove that he taught loose living. No wonder Paul was eager to get to Rome! He wanted to share with them the fullness of the Gospel of Christ.

## Paul was not ashamed of the Gospel ##

Paul was not ashamed of the gospel for two reasons. The first is that the gospel revives men's lives. Dead in sin, and without the Lord, men go through the motions of living. But in reality, without any real purpose, they wonder why they exist. Paul was not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God unto salvation. It is literally the dunamis—from which we get our words "dynamic" and "dynamite"—to totally turn people around and give them reason for being.

The second reason Paul was not ashamed of the gospel is that it reveals God's love. God's love is seen in the fact that He doesn't just wink at sin and say, "Boys will be boys." After all, who would want to live in a community in which righteousness was not enforced, in which police officers simply said, "People will be people. So let's just close our eyes to robberies and murders"? If that was the policy of the community in which you lived, you would move. God neither winks at sin nor wipes us out because of sin. Rather, He washes away our sin by the blood of His Son
Here's where many of us are vulnerable to error. We know salvation is from faith because we begin by simply embracing the Good News of the gospel but then we go from faith to works. We think we have to mobilize, organize, and agonize over our spirituality.

"No, " says Paul. "It's from faith to faith." The just shall live by faith. Faith is not only the starting point of your salvation—it's the staying power of your Christian walk. "Even as you received Christ," Paul would say to the Colossians, "so walk ye in Him" (see Col_2:6). "Oh foolish Galatians," he would write, "are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh?" (see Gal_3:1-3). The just shall live by faith—faith in the finished work of the Cross, faith in the resurrected presence of Jesus Christ.
